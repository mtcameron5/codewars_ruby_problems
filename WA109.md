### Assignment
* On `line #` the local variable `var_name` is initialized to the `obj_type` `obj_name`. 

```
greeting = 'Hello'

loop do 
  greeting = 'Hi'
  break
end 

puts greeting
```

* The `do..end` alongside the `loop` method invocation on lines 3 to 6 defines a block, within which `greeting` is reassigned to the String `Hi` on `line 4`. 
* The `puts` method is invoked on line 8 with the variable `greeting` passed to it as an argument; since 

Questions? 

What happens if we don't do anything with the return value. For example the puts method is called without considering its return value

If an error is thrown at some point and other code is not run because of this should we explain what the other code would do if the error weren't to be thrown.
